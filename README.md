## Week 1
First week back for semester 2!

## Week 2
Week 2 of the semester and we are full steam ahead into getting things done. This week, me and the team worked on getting the game project questions answered, inputting what we wanted to get done this semester into the timeline gantt, setting up trello and making a commitment to actually using it and finally, getting the template completed for the project pitch deck.  

The timeline gantt for semester 2 with a breakdown of the things we want to try and implement:

This is the Trello board set up for semester 2, however, it is still bare bones and needs more work:

So far, week 2 has been fairly productive, each of the team members have put in some good work in getting these documents ready, and we have also worked with Tom on a logo design for the game, he has done amazing work and we are all very happy with the logo design chosen.  

## Week 3
Week 3 was focused on finishing the pitch deck draft and other documents required for submission. We had added the remaining information we wanted to showcase in the pitch deck, and tried to adapt it to both the work required for university and what we want to do with the project after university.  

Tom was able to come up with some mock up posters and some more materials that we ended up using as the background in the slides, as well as colouring the pitch deck to fit a theme.
