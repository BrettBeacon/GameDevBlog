## Week 1
First week back for semester 2!

## Week 2
Week 2 of the semester and we are full steam ahead into getting things done. This week, me and the team worked on getting the game project questions answered, inputting what we wanted to get done this semester into the timeline gantt, setting up trello and making a commitment to actually using it and finally, getting the template completed for the project pitch deck.  

The timeline gantt for semester 2 with a breakdown of the things we want to try and implement:

This is the Trello board set up for semester 2, however, it is still bare bones and needs more work:

So far, week 2 has been fairly productive, each of the team members have put in some good work in getting these documents ready, and we have also worked with Tom on a logo design for the game, he has done amazing work and we are all very happy with the logo design chosen.  

## Week 3
Week 3 was focused on finishing the pitch deck draft and other documents required for submission. We had added the remaining information we wanted to showcase in the pitch deck, and tried to adapt it to both the work required for university and what we want to do with the project after university.  

Tom was able to come up with some mock up posters and some more materials that we ended up using as the background in the slides, as well as colouring the pitch deck to fit a theme. The final draft poster has some changes from the mock up Tom was able to come up with, but it is a improvement and fits the theme perfectly.

This is the poster Tom was able to mock up for the game and game title with the nuclear green theme.

## Week 4
Week 4 was when we presented our pitch deck to the class. I am super happy with the work that was put in, and considering it is just a draft, it has turned out really nice. We can now start to fill it out with the content that we make through the weeks and get it ready for the final presentation.  

This was also the start of sprint 2, however, I have started working on the implementation of the weapons system, along side the animations and movement required for this, ideally, this was meant to be started back in the end of sprint 1, according to the timeline gantt we had set up, but things just got ahead of me, and I have had to move it to starting in sprint 2.  

I have researched on how I might best achieve what I want for the shooting and weapons system, and found some interesting ways of achieving it, however, it also means I will need to start from scratch with the character movement system, as at this stage, what is currently implemented will directly clash with how the new system will be set up.  

Just a reminder of where we are starting, and hopefully, in another 8-10 weeks, the differences will be massive.

## Week 5
Where are the weeks going?!?! End of week 5 already, end of sprint 2, god damn it, time seems to fly.  

I have started implementing the new movement system with weapons and guns in mind, I have made a new scene to work in so I'm not having to go through menus and what not for testing purposes. I also implemented a new character model from the Unity Asset store just so I can play around with the animation rigging system in Unity, and adding weapons to hand slots. This wasn't possible with the current character model from Daniel, as I didnt have a version of him in a T-Pose, which I need for animation purposes. Daniel is also redesigning the hero character anyway, so using a new model isnt a big deal at this stage.  

There is a lot of work to be done, and time seems to go faster than you remember, especially when you need to get things done.
